__handy, micro power supply__ to drive your projects in all kind of situations! SquarePower fits in any toolbox and in any invention

* connects to an USB-C source, old laptop charger, ... (max 24V)
* outputs a fixed (1,8 V 2,5 V 3,3 V 5V 9V 12V), an adjustable voltage settings (0,8-17V) or simply redirects Vin to Vout
* up to a current 2,1A (max 3A - needs cooling)
* all these specs are running on two separate DCDC converters. Yes, you're right: damn, it's dual output capable!

## 🛠 For DIY'er:
All you need are steady hands for the soldering part. Small SMD (Surface Mount) components can be tricky to solder for beginners.

🙏 Please if you need to shop for parts, it would be great that you use the supply links below. As they are affilated, you're supporting me directly to continue to deliver new projects to the community! Thank you!
At the moment I have no possibility for a larger production and distribution. Of course, I am ready for any cooperation to industrialize the production. 

## 👨🏼‍🏫Tutorials
Soon updates for:
* How to build your own & first steps
* Discover Ohm's Law with an USB Power Meter

## ✔ToDo
- [x] Redesign connections so the switches are symmetrical
- [ ] Add some space for soldering screw terminal right in place
- [ ] Add some tutorials about making and using!
- [ ] Design a nice laser-cutted and 3D printed enclosure
- [ ] Test if possible to arduino-drive the Enable Pin with a BSS138 Level Shifter
