🙏 Please if you need to shop for parts, it would be great that you use the supply links below. As they are affilated, you're supporting me directly to continue to deliver new projects to the community! Thank you!
At the moment I have no possibility for a larger production and distribution. Of course, I am ready for any cooperation to industrialize the production. 

## 👨🏼‍🏫Tutorials
Soon updates for:
* How to build your own & first steps
* Discover Ohm's Law with an USB Power Meter

## ✔ToDo
- [x] Redesign connections so the switches are symmetrical
- [ ] Add some space for soldering screw terminal right in place
- [ ] Add some tutorials about making and using!
- [ ] Design a nice laser-cutted and 3D printed enclosure
